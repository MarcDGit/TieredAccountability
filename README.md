# Tiered Accountability Dashboard (TAD)

A comprehensive web application built with Streamlit and Python for managing operational excellence through tiered accountability and escalation processes.

## üéØ Overview

The Tiered Accountability Dashboard (TAD) is designed to support lean management principles by providing a structured approach to issue escalation, accountability tracking, and operational excellence. The system enables organizations to implement a tiered hierarchy where issues can be efficiently escalated, tracked, and resolved with clear accountability at each level.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Database Layer** (`database.py`)
   - SQLite-based persistence
   - Entity relationships for tiers, people, and escalations
   - Full audit trail and history tracking

2. **Application Layer** (`app.py`)
   - Streamlit web interface
   - Real-time dashboard updates
   - Role-based access control

3. **Data Models**
   - **Tiers**: Hierarchical levels of accountability
   - **People**: Users assigned to specific tiers with defined roles
   - **Escalations**: Issues tracked through the tier hierarchy

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd tiered-accountability-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8501`

### Initial Setup

1. **Admin Panel Setup**:
   - Navigate to "üîß Admin Panel"
   - Create your tier hierarchy (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
   - Add people to each tier with appropriate roles

2. **Start Using**:
   - Select your identity from the dashboard sidebar
   - Begin creating and managing escalations

## üìä Core Features

### 1. Admin Panel
- **Tier Management**: Create and configure hierarchical accountability levels
- **People Management**: Add users and assign them to tiers with specific roles
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View system-wide metrics and performance indicators

### 2. Escalation Dashboard
- **Personal Dashboard**: View personal metrics and escalations
- **Create Escalations**: Log new issues with urgency levels
- **Manage Escalations**: Take actions on escalations (escalate, provide feedback, close)
- **Tier Overview**: Monitor tier-specific performance metrics

### 3. Workflow Management
- **Escalation Creation**: Issues start in the creator's tier
- **Tier-to-Tier Escalation**: Structured escalation to higher tiers
- **Feedback Loop**: Resolution feedback flows back to originating tier
- **Closure Process**: Original creator validates and closes escalations

## üîÑ Escalation Workflow

### Standard Process Flow

1. **Issue Creation** (Tier 1)
   - Person A creates escalation in Tier 1
   - Status: "Open"
   - Visible in Tier 1 dashboard

2. **Escalation** (Tier 1 ‚Üí Tier 2)
   - Tier 1 escalates to Tier 2
   - Assigns to specific Person B in Tier 2
   - Status: "In Progress"
   - Visible in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 dashboards

3. **Resolution** (Tier 2)
   - Person B works on the issue
   - Provides feedback and resolution
   - Status: "Pending Feedback"
   - Returns to Tier 1 visibility

4. **Closure** (Tier 1)
   - Person A reviews feedback
   - Closes escalation if satisfied
   - Status: "Closed"
   - Removed from active dashboards

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Available Actions |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Open** | Newly created, awaiting action | Escalate to next tier |
| **In Progress** | Currently being worked on | Provide feedback |
| **Pending Feedback** | Resolved, awaiting creator review | Close escalation |
| **Closed** | Issue resolved and confirmed | View history only |

### Urgency Levels

| Level | Description | Visual Indicator | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Critical** | üö® Emergency, system down | Red (blinking) | Production outages, safety issues |
| **High** | üìï Urgent, affects operations | Red | Performance issues, customer impact |
| **Medium** | üìô Standard business issues | Orange | Normal workflow problems |
| **Low** | üìó Non-critical, can wait | Green | Enhancements, documentation |

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Personal Metrics
- **Created by Me**: Total escalations created
- **Assigned to Me**: Escalations currently assigned
- **Pending My Feedback**: Items awaiting review
- **Average Days Open**: Mean resolution time

### Tier Metrics
- **Total Escalations**: All escalations processed
- **Open Escalations**: Currently active items
- **Average Resolution Time**: Mean time to close
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage escalated to higher tiers
- **Critical Issues**: Count of critical urgency items

### System Analytics
- **Escalations by Urgency**: Distribution pie chart
- **Escalations by Status**: Current status breakdown
- **Resolution Time by Tier**: Performance comparison
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical patterns

## üîê Roles and Permissions

### Role Definitions

| Role | Permissions | Typical Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Member** | Create escalations, view own items | Front-line operators |
| **Lead** | Manage team escalations, escalate | Team leaders, supervisors |
| **Manager** | Cross-tier visibility, analytics | Department managers |
